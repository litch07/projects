# Structured Programming Lab (SPL)

This folder contains the projects I completed for the **Structured Programming Laboratory** course (SPL).  
These projects focus on strengthening fundamentals in **C programming**, clean modular code, and logical problem solving.

### 🧠 Topics Covered
- Basic C syntax  
- Conditions, loops, and functions  
- Arrays, strings, and simple pointers  
- File handling  

### 📂 Project Folders
Each project has its own folder with a README and source code.

Examples:
- `contact-management-system/` - File-based contact management system  

### 🎯 Purpose
These SPL projects helped build my core programming foundation and prepared me for advanced courses like OOP and Data Structures.
