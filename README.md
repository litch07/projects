# Projects

This repository contains my **course-based** and **personal** software projects, mainly built using  
**C, C++, and Java**. Each project is organized into a separate folder with clear structure and a README explaining the idea, features, and how to run it.

## 📚 Course-Based Projects

Projects grouped by the university courses where they were developed:

### 🔸 Structured Programming Lab in C
Location: `spl-lab-c/`  
Focus on writing clean C code, modular functions, loops, arrays, pointers, and file handling.

### 🔸 Object Oriented Programming in Java
Location: `oop-lab-java/`  
Covers object-oriented design, Java classes, inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and Swing-based GUI apps.

## 🧪 Personal Projects

Location: `personal/`  
Projects and experiments built outside of coursework — driven by curiosity, self-learning, and practice.

---

## 📝 Goal

My aim is to write **clear, maintainable, and well-documented code** while building a strong foundation in software development and core CS concepts.
