# Projects

This repository contains my **course-based** and **personal** software projects, mainly developed in **C, C++, and Java**.  
Each project is placed inside its own folder with a clear structure and a dedicated README describing the idea, features, and how to run it.

## 📚 Course-Based Projects

Projects created as part of my undergraduate coursework:

### 🔸 [Structured Programming Language Lab](spl-lab-c/)
Focus on writing clean procedural C programs using:
- loops, functions, arrays, pointers  
- modular program structure  
- file handling  
- logical problem-solving

### 🔸 [Object Oriented Programming Lab](oop-lab-java/)
Projects demonstrating OOP concepts and Java development:
- classes, objects, inheritance, abstraction  
- encapsulation and polymorphism  
- Java Swing–based GUI applications  
- multi-class architecture

## 🧪 Personal Projects

Self-driven projects built outside academic requirements:  
Location: [`personal/`](personal/)

These projects reflect curiosity, experimentation, and continuous learning — with a focus on improving design, structure, and real-world problem-solving.

## 🎯 Goal

To maintain a clean and organized collection of my programming work, showcasing my growth in software development and strengthening my foundation in **core CS concepts**, **problem-solving**, and **clean code practices**.
