# Projects

This repository contains my **course-based** and **personal** software projects, mainly built using **C, C++**, and **Java**.  
Each project is organized into its own folder with a clear structure and a README explaining the idea, features, and how to run it.

## 📚 Course-Based Projects

Projects grouped by the university courses where they were developed.

### 🔸 Structured Programming Lab (C)  
Location: [`spl-lab-c/`](spl-lab-c/)  
Focuses on writing clean C code using modular functions, loops, arrays, pointers, and basic file handling.

### 🔸 Object Oriented Programming Lab (Java)  
Location: [`oop-lab-java/`](oop-lab-java/)  
Covers object-oriented design in Java: classes, inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and Swing-based GUI applications.

## 🧪 Personal Projects

Location: [`personal/`](personal/)  
Projects and experiments built outside of coursework — driven by curiosity, self-learning, and practice.

---

## 📝 Goal

My aim is to write clear, maintainable, and well-documented code while building a strong foundation in software development and core CS concepts.
