# Projects

This repository contains my **course-based** and **personal** projects, mainly developed in **C, C++**, **Java**, and **embedded C++ (ESP32)**.  
Each project is organized into its own folder with a clear structure and a README explaining the idea, features, and how to run it.

## 📚 Course-Based Projects

Projects created as part of my undergraduate coursework.

### 🔸 Structured Programming Language Lab  
Location: [`spl-lab-c/`](spl-lab-c/)  
Focus on clean procedural C programming with:
- loops and conditionals  
- functions and modular design  
- arrays, pointers  
- basic file handling  

### 🔸 Object Oriented Programming Lab  
Location: [`oop-lab-java/`](oop-lab-java/)  
Covers object-oriented design in Java, including:
- classes and objects  
- inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation  
- multi-class architecture  
- basic GUI development using Swing  

### 🔸 Electronics Laboratory  
Location: [`electronics-lab/`](electronics-lab/)  
Hardware-focused course projects that combine:
- ESP32 microcontroller programming  
- sensors and AC power monitoring modules  
- relay-based load control  
- embedded web dashboards (HTML/CSS/JS hosted from the ESP32)

## 🧪 Personal Projects  

Location: [`personal/`](personal/)  

Independent projects built outside of coursework — focused on experimentation, self-learning, and applying concepts in practical ways.

---

## 📝 Goal

My aim is to write **clear, maintainable, and well-documented code** while building a strong foundation in software development, core CS concepts, and problem-solving.
