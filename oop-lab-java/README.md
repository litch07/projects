# Object Oriented Programming Lab (Java)

This folder contains projects from my **Object Oriented Programming Laboratory** course.

These projects focus on applying **OOP concepts in Java**, using both console-based and Swing-based applications.

### 🧠 Topics Covered
- Classes and objects  
- Inheritance and polymorphism  
- Abstraction and interfaces  
- Encapsulation  
- Basic file handling in Java  
- Java Swing (for GUI-based projects)

### 📂 Project Folders

Each project has its own folder with a README and source code.

Examples:
- `student-management-system/` – manage student records using OOP design  
- `library-management-system/` – Java or Swing-based system to manage books  
- `billing-system/` – console or GUI program to handle simple billing logic  

*(You can rename or adjust these based on your actual projects.)*
